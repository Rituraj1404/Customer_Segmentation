# Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, helping businesses identify distinct groups of customers based on purchasing behavior and other characteristics.

## Overview

Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses to understand their customer base and tailor their marketing strategies. In this notebook, we use data analysis and clustering algorithms to segment customers into different groups. This can provide insights into customer preferences, behaviors, and demographics.

## Dataset

- *Data Source*: customer_segmentation.csv
- *Features*: The dataset includes features such as customer ID, purchasing habits, demographics, etc.

## Key Steps in the Notebook

1. *Data Preprocessing*:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Feature scaling and normalization.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns in the dataset.

2. *Clustering Algorithm*:
   - We used *K-means clustering* *Heirarichal Clustering* and *DBSCAN* to group customers based on their features.
   - Finding the optimal number of clusters using the *Elbow Method* or *Silhouette Score*.
   - Drawing Dendograms to find the optimal number of clusters in Heirarichal Clustering.

3. *Visualizations*:
   - Visualizing the clusters to understand how customers are grouped.
   - Insights into the characteristics of each customer group.
